# Spotify Data Analysis Project
The goal of this project is to analyze user data that can be obtained through Spotify after a long time using the platform.
The analysis of personal data is now a main selling point for spotify with their "spotify's wrapped" release every year for each user.
Being able to analyze the data without waiting a year for it can be greatly insightful and fun to do!
